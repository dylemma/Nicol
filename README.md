## Unleash the Power of the Scala

Nicol is an attempt to create a 2D game library that uses all the advantages of a pure Scala implemented class collection.
So Nicol supports many of the features you miss in Java-based libraries:

* Lazy resource loading
* Native use of Tuples and Lists
* Actors!
* Pattern matching
